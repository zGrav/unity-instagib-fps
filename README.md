Trying out Unity with a instagib FPS approach

I'm mainly doing this out of curiosity sake, don't expect the cleanest code nor the best approaches

What this might have:

- Probably multiplayer
- Probably working physics/collision
- Poor-ass map design (Hey, I'm not good with designing shit, okay?)
- Poor-ass char models (read above)
- Poor-ass hit sounds/music (read above 2x)
